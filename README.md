# Android-GSDemo-GoogleMap
A Demo for using DJI Mobile SDK to create a GroundStation App using Google Map. It's a counterpart of iOS-GSDemo using GoogleMap. In this demo, we add the functions to configure the waypoints, upload the waypoints, start the ground station task, stop the ground station task.
